1. Find an incline bench. This exercise will work best if you have a support bar under which to hook your feet as well.</h6>
        
        <h6> 2. 
Sit on the bench with your knees bent. Your feet should be on the uphill side of the bench.</h6>
        
        <h6>3. Lie down so that your upper body is facing downhill. Place your hands behind your neck or on the side of your neck.</h6>
