1. Chin ups are a great exercise to hit the back and biceps. The underhand grip means the biceps are involved much more than in during a pull up. Grip a chin up bar using an underhand grip with your hands about 6-10 inches apart.</h6>
        
        <h6> 2. 
Lower your body down so that you're hanging from the bar. This is the starting position.</h6>
        
        <h6>3. Slowly pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar, and then lower right back down to the starting position.</h6>
        
        <h6>4. Repeat for desired reps.</h6>
